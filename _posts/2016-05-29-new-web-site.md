This is a new web site for the space-time conservation element and solution element (CESE) method.  [The original web site created by the author of the method](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/microbus/) hasn't been maintained for a while.  We plan to build a new web site for the latest development of the CESE method, and provide comprehensive information to help the users.

The web site is hosted and being developed at [github](https://github.com/cesehub/cesehub).
